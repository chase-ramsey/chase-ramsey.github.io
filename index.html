                <h2>About me</h2>
                <p>
                    If I had to explain myself as simply as possible, I'd say that I'm a person who is interested in learning about <strong>everything</strong>. I have studied literature at the graduate level; written articles, news, and reviews about videogames from a critical perspective; spent countless hours diving deep in conversation with friends about music, movies, and TV shows; and now, worked my way through a six-month, full-stack web development bootcamp. I couldn't be happier to find myself in a discipline with so much respect for creativity and opportunity to learn, and I'm excited to make my mark on the field.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My software development background is in front-end technologies—HTML, CSS, Javascript, and AngularJS, mainly—and in the Python/Django stack for server-side development. I like working on projects that present an interesting technical challenge, especially if the product helps enable fresh, meaningful conversations and experiences with users. I'm looking forward to joining a team where I can continue to grow as a developer and find new, lively interests to pursue.

                        I’m nearing the finish line of an intense, six-month software development bootcamp at Nashville Software School, where I’m participating in their 13th full-time class of full-stack web students—the first class to learn Python/Django as a server-side development stack. Both individually and as part of a group, I’ve created complex single-page applications using AngularJS and built database-driven applications on the server-side using Python. I’m currently looking for a job as a developer in Nashville, and I look forward to contributing to a vibrant team environment as well as continuing to grow and learn.

                    <p>
                        I graduated with my master’s from UT in 2014, and shortly after, relocated to Nashville when my wife was hired to work at Vanderbilt. Before starting at NSS, I spent several months doing writing work remotely from home. Some of this work was social media writing: I worked for a company called Social Joey, where I wrote and reposted content for Facebook, Twitter, Google+, and LinkedIn pages and created short blog posts for clients.

                        I also completed an editorial internship at the videogame news and criticism website <a href="http://www.killscreen.com" target="_blank">Kill Screen</a>, where I helped with some basic operations of the site. I wrote weekly news posts as an intern and continued to contribute reviews and feature articles as a freelancer after my internship ended (a sample of my videogame writing is linked below—check it out!).

                    <h2>Research & Teaching</h2>
                    <p>
                        After finishing my BA in English at Lee University in 2011, I wasn’t done with my tour of literature and theory. So, in the fall of 2012, I started my MA in English at the University of Tennessee, where I enrolled with a teaching assistantship. Over the next two years, I was able to explore countless new and exciting ideas, and while teaching, I was able to share some of those ideas with students.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In fulfilling my assistantship, I taught two sections of freshman composition in both the fall and spring semesters of 2013-14, and after I graduated, I stayed on as a lecturer on a part-time appointment to teach four more sections in fall 2014. Although they were composition classes, my courses always had a theme, like “internet culture” and “the future”. I walked students through styles of research and argument in different disciplines, always with an eye toward current events and cultural developments.

                <p>
                    Broadsheet requests up-to-date RSS feeds from a handful of major media outlets, parses the resulting XML documents, and displays the fetched articles in the browser. All users start with the same basic feeds, but users can also add custom feeds by submitting a simple form. AngularJS structures user interactions with the app—such as article rendering, topic filters, and user comments—and Firebase is used to store persistent application and user data.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>NOTE:</strong> because Broadsheet currently only operates on the browser-side, to use the app, users will need to install a browser extension to clear up any issues with cross-origin resource sharing (CORS). Check out the Github repository linked below for more details and instructions.
